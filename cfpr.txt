CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

                    22st International Conference on
          Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science
                              RAMiCS 2026

    Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences
                  Będlewo, Poland, 7-10 April 2026

                 https://ramics-conf.github.io/2026


Additionally to the standard Call for Papers, RAMiCS is also calling
for presentations or short contributions.  We are hence calling for
presentations of original, unfinished, already published, or otherwise
interesting work within the topics of the RAMiCS conferences.  The
submission can be in the form of a poster, an abstract, a paper
submitted to or published at another conference, or any other format.
A presentation may also be a tutorial, or an open question of interest
to the community.  These presentations will *not* be published in the
conference proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  Submission:          26 February 2026
  Notification:        3 March 2026
  RAMiCS registration: 7 March 2026

INVITED SPEAKERS:

* Lorenzo Clemente, University of Warsaw, Poland
* Anupam Das, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom
* Jana Wagemaker, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands

GENERAL INFORMATION:

Since 1994, the RAMICS conference series has been the main venue for
research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic
formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological
tools in computer science and beyond.

TOPICS:

We invite presentations in the general fields of algebras relevant to
computer science and applications of such algebras. Topics include but
are not limited to:

* Theory
  - algebras such as semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings,
    Kleene algebras, relation algebras and quantales
  - their connections with program logics and other logics
  - their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages,
    games, networks and programming languages
  - the development of algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic,
    coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories
  - their formalisation with theorem provers

* Applications
  - tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and
    verification
  - quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing
    systems and processes
  - algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis,
    social choice, optimisation and control
  - industrial applications
